                    I am going to answer these one at a time. So let me write about each, one through four and then move on to the next game.

Spectres and spirits:
~/images/ss.png
2 week game jam, 6 person team
a fun fast paced game about possessing different character and using their abilities and purchased upgrades to defeat the boss at the end of the level
The chalenge of this game was keeping focussed over two week and making sure the code was maintainable over the time period

Time Slice:
~/images/ts.png
48 hours, 4 person team, 1st place
a fight against time where the player had to learn the map and speed run the game with only 5 minutes. A good quote for this game is "Time slice, a slice of time"
I had the most fun making this game, because every step of the way we enjoyed playing the game as much as making it. We even took the game further after the jam was over

Fat rat and spouce mouse:
~/images/ratmouse.png
48 hours, 3 person team, 3rd place
A small simple game where the player controlls two different characters in two different ways trying to chase a highscore and not get eaten by the cat
This was by far the hardest game to create. Our team was did not enjoy working on the game, and it was very difficult to stay interested throughout the jam expereince, but we pushed through and got third place

Brad to the bone:
72 hour, 5 person, 1st place, 1st ever game jam
A quick game about being the villain, running over kids sandcastles and score points in arcade fasion with hidden unique mechanics
THis was the first game jam I ever participated in, and I was very exiceted to win first place with my friends. This was a unique experinece as well as I truly learned a lot about my friend and myself working with them as a team

PackageUp:
1 week, just me
A single screen puzzle game made for confounding calendar about packing up the streets with cars and trucks
I was dedicated to this project to try something on my own for the first time and hoped that my game would get featured in a youtube video (it did not sadly) I also learned a new engine other than unity during that jam
